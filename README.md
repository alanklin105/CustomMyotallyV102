First, all credits go to Pieter Both and his team that developed Myotally as a tool to automate the quantiﬁcation of muscle ﬁber size, number, and central nucleation from immunoﬂuorescent stains of mouse skeletal muscle cross-sections. See their paper here.

They also published their source code on Github found here. The source code in this repository is where I made my changes. 

These changes serve as an improvement to several problems I faced while using their tool. I hope it benefits you, as well.
