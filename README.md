First, all credits go to Pieter Both and his team that developed Myotally as a tool to automate the quantiﬁcation of muscle ﬁber size, number, and central nucleation from immunoﬂuorescent stains of mouse skeletal muscle cross-sections. See their paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387957750_Protocol_for_quantifying_muscle_fiber_size_number_and_central_nucleation_of_mouse_skeletal_muscle_cross-sections_using_Myotally_software).

They also published their source code on Github found [here](https://github.com/pieterboth/Myotally). The source code in this [repository](https://github.com/pieterboth/Myotally/releases/tag/Myotally_V1.0.2) is where I made my changes. 

These changes serve as an improvement to several problems I faced while using their tool. I hope it benefits you, as well.
